# Cheatsheet

Common commands I seem to misplace......



## gotta GIT it

When .gitirgnore stops ignoring: 

`git rm -r --cached .`
`git add .`

When your POC gets too wild and you just want to start over again:

`git reset --hard origin/<branch>`
  

## NPM

When you're trying to figure out which npm version is right for you <3 

`npm view @angular -> to see previous versions` 

## NODE

Quickly switch node versions by installing npm n package:

`sudo n 6.9.5`

`sudo n 8.9.2`
